# üå§Ô∏è SkyCast ‚Äì Real-Time Weather Forecasting App

> **SkyCast** is a fast, responsive web application that delivers current, hourly, and 7-day weather forecasts for any location in the world. Built with React, Tailwind CSS, and the OpenWeather API, the project demonstrates API integration, state management with hooks, and modern front-end deployment.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **UI Layer (React + Tailwind)**  
   - `App.jsx` mounts global context and routes.  
   - `SearchBar.jsx` emits a `(lat, lon)` pair via context on submit.  
   - `WeatherPanel.jsx` consumes context and triggers `useWeather(lat, lon)`.

2. **Data Layer (`useWeather` hook)**  
   - Calls `/api/weather?lat={}&lon={}` (proxy) with `fetch`.  
   - Normalizes the OpenWeather JSON into a slimmed-down object: `current`, `hourly`, `daily`.  
   - Caches the object for 30 minutes in `localStorage`.

3. **Proxy Server (`/server/index.js`, optional)**  
   - Express middleware adds API key from `process.env` and sets `Cache-Control`.  
   - Prevents exposing the key in front-end bundle and lets you add rate-limit headers.

4. **Rendering**  
   - Components subscribe to the normalized weather object and re-render automatically.  
   - Icons from **Heroicons** or **Weather Icons** display conditionally.  
   - The `<body>` gradient or image gets a CSS class like `bg-rain` or `bg-clear` via effect.

5. **Build & Deployment**  
   - `vite build` produces a 100 KB gzipped bundle.  
   - Vercel detects the React template, builds, and serves from its edge CDN.

\*You can skip the server entirely by calling the API directly and hiding the key in environment variables if your platform allows it.
